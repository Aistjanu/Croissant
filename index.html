    <h2>~ What is a croissant? ~</h2>
    <p>
      A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry of Austrian origin,
      named for its historical crescent shape. Croissants and other viennoiserie
      are made of a layered yeast-leavened dough. Croissants are named for their
      historical crescent shape. The dough is layered with butter, rolled and
      folded several times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a
      technique called laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky
      texture, similar to a puff pastry.
